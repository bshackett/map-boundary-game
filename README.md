# Map Boundary Game
Try to draw the outline of a country, and then check to see how accurate you were.

Possibly less of a game, and more of a studying tool.

## Local Development
Since the project uses javascript modules, a web server must be used locally that can serve the javascript files. (You can't just spin up `file:///path/to/index.html` in a browser).  
 - common option 1: `python3 -m http.server 8686`
 - common option 2: `static-server --port 8686` ([docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server#getting-started))

## TODO / Roadmap
 - speed up grading algorithm
 - possibly improve accuracy of grading algorithm
